Exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Deep Learning,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the art of extracting information from unstructured text. This course teaches you the latest developments in Natural Language Processing like BERT, Transformers using PyTorch.Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the hottest field in the data science space right now. The demand for NLP experts and data scientists is through the roof.

We have seen a remarkable rise in the amount of research and breakthroughs in NLP recently. We can trace this recent rise to one (seismic) paper – “Attention is All You Need” by Google AI. This breakthrough has spawned so many new and exciting NLP libraries that enable us to work with text in ways that were previously limited to our imagination (or Hollywood).

These NLP deep learning developments have spawned some mind-boggling applications. We’re sure you’ve already interacted with and used some of them yourself:

Human-level chatbots (dialogue systems like Google Duplex and Meena)
Text generation (Machines writing text from scrtach, such as OpenAI’s GPT-2 model)


Here’s a quick list of the latest Natural Language Processing concepts in deep learning every NLP expert and even enthusiast should know:

Language Modeling
Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling
Attention Mechanism
Transformer Architecture
Transfer Learning in NLP, and much more!


These are key NLP deep learning concepts you should master if you want to successfully navigate through the NLP goldmine.

Why PyTorch for Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
Every once in a while, there comes a library or framework that reshapes and reimagines how we look at the field of deep learning.

We can safely say that PyTorch is on that list of deep learning frameworks. It has helped accelerate the research that goes into deep learning models by making them computationally faster and less expensive (a data scientist’s dream!).

You will love working with PyTorch for NLP tasks like building language models and creating deep learning powered chatbots. You will quickly find yourself leaning on PyTorch’s flexibility and efficiency quite often for NLP.","Recent Developments in NLP

In the past couple of years, the amount of research and breakthroughs in NLP has skyrocketed. Now every month we get to see state-of-the-art NLP models and architectures. 

This incredible rise of NLP can be traced back to the paper – “Attention is All You Need” by Google AI in June 2017. This breakthrough has spawned so many new and exciting NLP models and some key developments are listed below:

Transformer Architecture - It achieved state-of-the-art status on sequence modeling tasks. It can handle long-range dependencies in text with ease

BERT - This architecture by Google took the Transformer a notch higher and achieved state-of-the-art performance in Language Modeling

GPT and GPT 2 - OpenAI’s GPT was state-of-the-art language model till BERT toppled it from the top spot and soon they launched GPT 2 a colossal language model which was trained on many GB’s of text scraped from the web

Transformers Library - This amazing library by Huggingface has democratized the use of Transformers. It has a large number of Transformer based pre-trained models that can also be fine-tuned.



In the modules given below, all the projects will be implemented using PyTorch.



Language Modeling

In this module, you will understand a very important sequence modeling task that is known as language modeling. This is the main ingredient in many modern NLP tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, speech recognition, etc.



Project: Building an Autocomplete System

In this project, you will train a Language Model from scratch and use it to automatically give next word suggestions to an input text. You will use PyTorch to implement this project.



Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling

Once you are familiar with the language model, you will learn about the sequence-to-sequence models wherein both the input and the output are sequences of different lengths. You will also get a thorough understanding of the architecture along with the attention mechanism.



Project: Neural Machine Translation

In this project you will get to apply sequence-to-sequence modeling to build a deep learning model to translate one language to another automatically. 



Transformers and Transfer Learning in NLP

The next step in your journey is the Transformer. In this module, you will understand the Transformers models in detail. You will also learn how Transformers are used to perform transfer learning in NLP. You will get to use the Transformers library by Huggingface.



Project: Text Classification using Transformers

You will fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer model to perform text classification on a new dataset. The domain of the new dataset will be different from that of the dataset on which the Transformer was trained.



Project: Build a Dialog System using RASA

Conversational agents or chatbots have been instrumental in across several industries. In this project you will build a chatbot using RASA, an open source. You will also learn to deploy the chatbot in slack.



Project: Build a Voice Command System

In this project you will not only use text data but audio data as well. The objective of this project is to build a deep learning system to convert a speech input to text. It can be used for tasks such as controlling home automation systems by just a few voice commands.

What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is the science of teaching machines how to learn by themselves. Machine Learning is re-shaping and revolutionizing the world and disrupting industries and job functions globally. 

Machine learning is so extensive that you probably use it numerous times a day without even knowing it. From unlocking your mobile phones using your face to giving your attendance using a biometric machine, machine learning is being used in almost every stage. 

In this age of machine learning, every aspiring data scientist is expected to upskill themselves in machine learning techniques & tools and apply them in real-world business problems.

What are the applications of Machine Learning?
Now that you get the hang of it, you might be asking what are some of the examples of machine learning and how does it affect our life? Here are a few examples where we use the outcome of machine learning already:
Smartphones detecting faces while taking photos or unlocking themselves

Facebook, LinkedIn or any other social media site recommending your friends and ads you might be interested in

Amazon recommending you the products based on your browsing history

 

Banks using Machine Learning to detect Fraud transactions in real-time

What kind of problems can be solved using Machine Learning?
Machine Learning problems can be divided into 3 broad classes:

Supervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised Machine Learning

Reinforcement Learning

Here is an illustration of these different machine learning problems:









Supervised Machine Learning: When you have past data with outcomes (labels in machine learning terminology) and you want to predict the outcomes for the future – you would use Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. Supervised Machine Learning problems can again be divided into 2 kinds of problems:
Classification Problems: When you want to classify outcomes into different classes. For example – whether a customer would default on their loan or not is a classification problem which is of high interest to any Bank
Regression Problem: When you are interested in answering how much – these problems would fall under the Regression umbrella. For example – what is the expected amount of default from a customer is a Regression problem

Unsupervised Machine Learning: There are times when you don’t want to exactly predict an Outcome. You just want to perform a segmentation or clustering. For example – a bank would want to have a segmentation of its customers to understand their behavior. This is an Unsupervised Machine Learning problem as we are not predicting any outcomes here.

Reinforcement Learning: It is said to be the hope of true artificial intelligence. And it is rightly said so because the potential that Reinforcement Learning possesses is immense. It is a slightly complex topic as compared to traditional machine learning but an equally crucial one for the future.

Top Data Science Projects for Analysts and Data Scientists,"Kick-start your career in data science with our data science courses and projects including learning on projects covering machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, natural language processing, reinforcement learning & data engineering.“How many data science projects have you completed so far?”
This is a very common question interviewers ask in data science interviews. We have conducted hundreds of these interviews for both data analyst and data scientist roles and this is quite often the jackpot question. This is especially true if you’re a fresher or a relative newcomer to data science.

Just doing courses or attaining certifications isn’t good enough. Almost everyone we know holds certifications in various aspects of data science. It adds no value to your resume if you don’t combine it with practical experience.

Ever heard of version control? It is one of the most important concepts in a data scientist’s daily role - and yet most newcomers and beginners haven’t even come across it! This is a fallacy you must overcome as soon as possible.

You need to understand how to navigate through Git and GitHub if you want to make it as a data science professional. While a lot of folks know about these tools (having used them for cloning open source code from Google Research and other top data science organizations), they never really understand their real purpose.

The beauty of version control will be akin to a revelation. The way you can create a remote project and have all your team members work on different features parallelly yet independently but still have a stable running code at the end of the day - priceless! A lot of the problem we face in data science while working remotely and independently will be erased with a quick understanding of Git and GitHub.

Yes, this course really is that important!

Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"What is sentiment analysis? Why is sentiment analysis so popular in data science? And how can you perform sentiment analysis? Find the answers to all these questions in this free course on Sentiment Analysis using Python!What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a technique used to analyse the emotion in a text. We can extract the attitude or the opinion of a piece of text and get insights on it. 
In the context of machine learning, you can think of Sentiment Analysis as a Classification problem where the text can either have a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment or a neutral one.


What are the applications of Sentiment Analysis in the industry?
In the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about 
a movie you liked or 
a book you didn’t like or 
a product you bought was not up to the mark.
Therefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customer’s opinion.
It is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis.
 

On what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis?
There are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases:

Sentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well.
Analyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not.
For other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/



What is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?
In the earlier days of Natural language processing and Sentiment Analysis, the sentiments could hold only 2 or 3 values: Positive or Negative, and Positive, Neutral or Negative.
However, with the advent of deep learning, we can now recognize the subtle emotions in a text as well.
This has made tasks like Sarcasm detection, fake news detection etc. popular in research areas of Natural language processing 


Can I add this project to my resume and use it in my Interview?
Sentiment Analysis is one of the most popular applications of Machine Learning and Classification in Natural language processing
We also encourage you to take up more diverse datasets and apply sentiment analysis on them.
Sentiment Analysis is also one of the first projects you would learn in your Natural language processing journey and as such is commonly asked in interviews.","1

Evaluation Metrics for Machine Learning Models,"What are evaluation metrics in machine learning? What are the different types of evaluation metrics? How do you gauge and improve your machine learning model? This course will teach you all about evaluation metrics for machine learning models.Evaluation Metrics are a Key Part of Machine Learning Models
Evaluation metrics form the backbone of improving your machine learning model. Without these evaluation metrics, we would be lost in a sea of machine learning model scores - unable to understand which model is performing well.

 

Wondering where evaluation metrics fit in? Here’s how the typical machine learning model building process works:

We build a machine learning model (both regression and classification included)
Get feedback from the evaluation metric(s)
Make improvements to the model
Use the evaluation metric to gauge the model’s performance, and
Continue until you achieve a desirable accuracy
 

Evaluation metrics, essentially, explain the performance of a machine learning model. An important aspect of evaluation metrics is their capability to discriminate among model results.

 

If you’ve ever wondered how concepts like AUC-ROC, F1 Score, Gini Index, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Confusion Matrix work, well - you’ve come to the right course!

As a Machine Learning and Data Science aspirant, you need to be able to answer these questions about evaluation metrics:
What is an evaluation metric?
What are the different types of evaluation metrics?
Do I really need to master evaluation metrics to understand machine learning?
What kind of evaluation metrics questions can I expect in an interview?
How do evaluation metrics help me improve my hackathon rankings?
Can I use the same evaluation metrics for regression as well as classification problems?
Is cross validation an evaluation metric?
You will learn all about evaluation metrics for machine learning models in this course. We will discuss the different types of evaluation metrics, including how to use them for evaluating classification and regression models.
Enroll for free
When to use Evaluation Metrics in Machine Learning?
We have seen plenty of analysts and aspiring data scientists not even bothering to check how robust their machine learning model is. Once they are finished building a model, they hurriedly map predicted values on unseen data. This is an incorrect approach.

 Simply building a machine learning model is not the motive! It’s about creating and selecting a model which gives high accuracy on an out of sample data (or unseen data). Hence, it is crucial to check the accuracy of your model prior to computing predicted values.

 This is where evaluation metrics help us.","Introduction

Common Questions Beginners Ask About Ensemble Learning What is Ensemble Learning?
Just like you come to a decision to buy a car by reading multiple reviews and opinions, in machine learning also, you can combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. This technique of combining multiple machine learning models is called ensemble learning.

 

Why do we need to know about Ensemble Learning?

Ensemble learning is one of the most effective ways to build an efficient machine learning model. You can build an ensemble machine learning model using simple models and yet get great scores which are at par with the resource-hungry models like neural networks.

 

What are the different types of Ensemble Learning techniques?

There are simple and advanced ensemble learning techniques.

Simple:
Max Voting
Averaging
Weighted Averaging
Advanced
Stacking
Blending
Bagging
Boosting
In bagging and Boosting, there are other popular models like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

We will be covering all these techniques comprehensively and with Python code in this course.

 

Do we use Ensemble Learning techniques only for classification or regression or both?

We can use ensemble learning for both types of machine learning problems: Classification and Regression. While techniques like Max Voting are used for classification, techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc can be used for both Classification and Regression problems.

 

What are the more popular ensemble learning techniques?

Ensemble learning techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and variants, XGBoost, and LightGBM are extremely popular in hackathons. Depending on the data we are dealing with, we can use these techniques as our machine learning models. For example, you can use LightGBM(Light Gradient Boosting) for large datasets, or CatBoost for when your data has categorical variables.

 

What is the intuition behind Bagging?

The idea behind bagging is combining the results of multiple models (for instance, all decision trees) to get a generalized result. Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregating) technique uses subsets (bags) to get a fair idea of the distribution (complete set).



What is the intuition behind Boosting?

Boosting is a sequential process, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model on subsets of the data. The succeeding models are dependent on the previous model. The boosting algorithm combines a number of weak learners to form a strong learner and boost your overall results.

 

What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?

While both bagging and boosting involve creating subsets, bagging makes these subsets randomly, while boosting prioritizes misclassified subsets. Additionally, at the final step in bagging, the weighted average is used, while boosting uses majority weighted voting.

 

Does ensemble learning improve my machine learning model?

In a word, yes! And that too drastically! Ensemble learn can improve the results of your machine learning even exponentially at times. There are two major benefits of Ensemble models:

More accurate predictions(closer to the actual value)
Combining multiple simple models to make a strong model improves the stability of the overall machine learning model.
As you will learn in the course, we will take a real-life dataset and study how ensemble learning improves the score of our machine learning model as compared to using only simple models.

 

Would knowing about ensemble learning help me crack interviews and hackathons?

Ensemble learning is the go-to method to achieve a high rank on hackathon leaderboards. You can go over the winning approaches of multiple hackathons, and there is a guarantee that a majority would have used an ensemble technique as their machine learning model.

Not only in hackathons but ensemble models are also used extremely popular in the industry because of how cost-effective they are. That is why, questions on random forest, gradient boosting, stacking, etc are often asked in interviews. Proposing an ensemble learning solution for a problem statement in an interview would always give you an edge over other solutions!

Common Questions Beginners Ask About Linear Programming
What is linear programming?

As we discuss in the course: “Linear programming is a simple technique where we depict complex relationships through linear functions and then find the optimum points. The important word in the previous sentence is depict. The real relationships might be much more complex – but we can simplify them to linear relationships.”



Why should you learn linear programming?

I’m sure you’ve had this question ever since you came across linear programming. Well - here’s the good news. The use cases of linear programming are all around us.

We use linear programming in both our personal and professional fronts. We use linear programming when we are driving from home to work and want to take the shortest route. Or when we have a project delivery we make strategies to make our team work efficiently for on time delivery. You get the idea!



What are the different linear programming terminologies?

Here are the key terminologies you’ll come across when learning linear programming:

●    Decision variables

●    Objective function

●    Constraints

●    Non-negativity restriction

We will cover each of these terms in detail inside the course.



What programming languages should you know to apply linear programming?

We showcase how to solve a linear programming problem using R in the course. However, you don’t need to know programming to learn linear programming! As we show in the course, you can also use Excel and even manual methods to solve a typical linear programming problem.

In real life, you might need to rely a lot more on languages like R and Python since the dataset you’ll be working with might be too big for Excel.



Can I solve a linear programming problem using Microsoft Excel?

Of course! That’s another powerful aspect of linear programming - you don’t need to master a programming language to solve linear programming problems. The ‘OpenSolver’ feature of Excel works perfectly and is made for linear programming problems.



What kind of projects can you do using linear programming?

Any project that requires optimization can be used to apply linear programming. As you’ll see inside the course, we solve various types of linear programming problems, including a fascinating case study of a chocolate manufacturing business wanting to maximize its profits.



Interview questions - what to expect around linear programming?

This is an interesting question. Personally, this is a mixed round as far as data science interviews go. You might not get a direct question on linear programming, such as “How would you use linear programming to solve an optimization problem?”.

Instead, there’s a high probability of getting a case study like optimizing delivery routes. This is where your knowledge of linear programming will come in handy.

We have seen a lot of folks not paying attention to this branch of data science - and that’s a mistake. It’s an excellent tool to have at your fingertips and will make your life in the data science field a lot easier.



What are the applications of linear programming in real-life?

There are innumerable applications of linear programming in the real-world. Here are 4 key ones that you'll come across:

●    Manufacturing industries use linear programming for analyzing their supply chain operations

Hypothesis Testing for Data Science and Analytics,"Hypothesis testing is one of the most fascinating steps data scientists perform and the most essential one! What is a hypothesis? How do I validate my hypothesis? Learn all the basics of hypothesis testing and how to implement them in your project!Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organisation of data. For all the data science and machine learning enthusiasts it is paramount to be well versed with various statistical concepts such as Hypothesis testing

Every day we find ourselves testing new ideas, finding the fastest route to the office, the quickest way to finish our work, or simply finding a better way to do something we love. The critical question, then, is whether our idea is significantly better than what we tried previously.

These ideas that we come up with on such a regular basis – that’s essentially what a hypothesis is. And testing these ideas to figure out which one works and which one is best left behind, is called hypothesis testing.

 

Statistics is the Grammar of Data Science
The course is structured in a manner that you will get ample of examples in each module. You’ll get to learn all about
Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing: The course begins with a simple-to-understand example on hypothesis testing. This chapter will clear all your basics like - Null Hypothesis, Alternative Hypothesis, Type 1 Error, Type 2 Error, and Significance Level.

p-value

What is the Z Test? The course introduces the most basic type of testing a hypothesis - Z test. Z tests are a statistical way of testing. The chapter covers the one sample as well as the two sample Z test.

What is the t-Test? The t-test is another test for validating the hypothesis. The chapter begins with a unique example and later covers both the one-sample and two-sample t-test.

Deciding between the Z Test and t-Test Are you confused on how to use these tests? Don’t worry, the course comprises a simple step-by-step guide on choosing the best test for your experiment.

Case Study: Hypothesis Testing for Coronavirus in Python You’ll get to put your theoretical knowledge into practice and see how well you can do. You will get to work on a hypothesis testing case study on the corona virus dataset in Python!
