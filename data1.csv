Exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Deep Learning,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the art of extracting information from unstructured text. This course teaches you the latest developments in Natural Language Processing like BERT, Transformers using PyTorch.Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the hottest field in the data science space right now. The demand for NLP experts and data scientists is through the roof.

We have seen a remarkable rise in the amount of research and breakthroughs in NLP recently. We can trace this recent rise to one (seismic) paper – “Attention is All You Need” by Google AI. This breakthrough has spawned so many new and exciting NLP libraries that enable us to work with text in ways that were previously limited to our imagination (or Hollywood).

These NLP deep learning developments have spawned some mind-boggling applications. We’re sure you’ve already interacted with and used some of them yourself:

Human-level chatbots (dialogue systems like Google Duplex and Meena)
Text generation (Machines writing text from scrtach, such as OpenAI’s GPT-2 model)


Here’s a quick list of the latest Natural Language Processing concepts in deep learning every NLP expert and even enthusiast should know:

Language Modeling
Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling
Attention Mechanism
Transformer Architecture
Transfer Learning in NLP, and much more!


These are key NLP deep learning concepts you should master if you want to successfully navigate through the NLP goldmine.

Why PyTorch for Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
Every once in a while, there comes a library or framework that reshapes and reimagines how we look at the field of deep learning.

We can safely say that PyTorch is on that list of deep learning frameworks. It has helped accelerate the research that goes into deep learning models by making them computationally faster and less expensive (a data scientist’s dream!).

You will love working with PyTorch for NLP tasks like building language models and creating deep learning powered chatbots. You will quickly find yourself leaning on PyTorch’s flexibility and efficiency quite often for NLP.","Recent Developments in NLP

In the past couple of years, the amount of research and breakthroughs in NLP has skyrocketed. Now every month we get to see state-of-the-art NLP models and architectures. 

This incredible rise of NLP can be traced back to the paper – “Attention is All You Need” by Google AI in June 2017. This breakthrough has spawned so many new and exciting NLP models and some key developments are listed below:

Transformer Architecture - It achieved state-of-the-art status on sequence modeling tasks. It can handle long-range dependencies in text with ease

BERT - This architecture by Google took the Transformer a notch higher and achieved state-of-the-art performance in Language Modeling

GPT and GPT 2 - OpenAI’s GPT was state-of-the-art language model till BERT toppled it from the top spot and soon they launched GPT 2 a colossal language model which was trained on many GB’s of text scraped from the web

Transformers Library - This amazing library by Huggingface has democratized the use of Transformers. It has a large number of Transformer based pre-trained models that can also be fine-tuned.



In the modules given below, all the projects will be implemented using PyTorch.



Language Modeling

In this module, you will understand a very important sequence modeling task that is known as language modeling. This is the main ingredient in many modern NLP tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, speech recognition, etc.



Project: Building an Autocomplete System

In this project, you will train a Language Model from scratch and use it to automatically give next word suggestions to an input text. You will use PyTorch to implement this project.



Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling

Once you are familiar with the language model, you will learn about the sequence-to-sequence models wherein both the input and the output are sequences of different lengths. You will also get a thorough understanding of the architecture along with the attention mechanism.



Project: Neural Machine Translation

In this project you will get to apply sequence-to-sequence modeling to build a deep learning model to translate one language to another automatically. 



Transformers and Transfer Learning in NLP

The next step in your journey is the Transformer. In this module, you will understand the Transformers models in detail. You will also learn how Transformers are used to perform transfer learning in NLP. You will get to use the Transformers library by Huggingface.



Project: Text Classification using Transformers

You will fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer model to perform text classification on a new dataset. The domain of the new dataset will be different from that of the dataset on which the Transformer was trained.



Project: Build a Dialog System using RASA

Conversational agents or chatbots have been instrumental in across several industries. In this project you will build a chatbot using RASA, an open source. You will also learn to deploy the chatbot in slack.



Project: Build a Voice Command System

In this project you will not only use text data but audio data as well. The objective of this project is to build a deep learning system to convert a speech input to text. It can be used for tasks such as controlling home automation systems by just a few voice commands.

What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is the science of teaching machines how to learn by themselves. Machine Learning is re-shaping and revolutionizing the world and disrupting industries and job functions globally. 

Machine learning is so extensive that you probably use it numerous times a day without even knowing it. From unlocking your mobile phones using your face to giving your attendance using a biometric machine, machine learning is being used in almost every stage. 

In this age of machine learning, every aspiring data scientist is expected to upskill themselves in machine learning techniques & tools and apply them in real-world business problems.

What are the applications of Machine Learning?
Now that you get the hang of it, you might be asking what are some of the examples of machine learning and how does it affect our life? Here are a few examples where we use the outcome of machine learning already:
Smartphones detecting faces while taking photos or unlocking themselves

Facebook, LinkedIn or any other social media site recommending your friends and ads you might be interested in

Amazon recommending you the products based on your browsing history

 

Banks using Machine Learning to detect Fraud transactions in real-time

What kind of problems can be solved using Machine Learning?
Machine Learning problems can be divided into 3 broad classes:

Supervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised Machine Learning

Reinforcement Learning

Here is an illustration of these different machine learning problems:









Supervised Machine Learning: When you have past data with outcomes (labels in machine learning terminology) and you want to predict the outcomes for the future – you would use Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. Supervised Machine Learning problems can again be divided into 2 kinds of problems:
Classification Problems: When you want to classify outcomes into different classes. For example – whether a customer would default on their loan or not is a classification problem which is of high interest to any Bank
Regression Problem: When you are interested in answering how much – these problems would fall under the Regression umbrella. For example – what is the expected amount of default from a customer is a Regression problem

Unsupervised Machine Learning: There are times when you don’t want to exactly predict an Outcome. You just want to perform a segmentation or clustering. For example – a bank would want to have a segmentation of its customers to understand their behavior. This is an Unsupervised Machine Learning problem as we are not predicting any outcomes here.

Reinforcement Learning: It is said to be the hope of true artificial intelligence. And it is rightly said so because the potential that Reinforcement Learning possesses is immense. It is a slightly complex topic as compared to traditional machine learning but an equally crucial one for the future.

Projects covered in this course
1. Customer Churn Prediction
A Bank wants to take care of customer retention for their product: savings accounts. The bank wants you to identify customers likely to churn balances below the minimum balance in the next quarter. You have the customers information such as age, gender, demographics along with their transactions with the bank. Your task as a data scientist would be to predict the propensity to churn for each customer.
Projects covered in this course
2. NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction
Uber, Lyft, Ola and many more online ride hailing services are trying hard to use their extensive data to create data products such as pricing engines, driver allotment etc. To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems for such services, it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied or in other words the trip duration. This project will cover techniques to extract important features and accurately predict trip duration for taxi trips in New York using data from TLC commission New York."
